Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour.
In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three.
It's estimated aboutÂ one in every 1,000 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with it than girls.

There's no "cure" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents.
