First of all, don’t panic!  Self harm is surprisingly common and takes many forms.  It is always very concerning and can even feel traumatic for a parent to discover their child is self harming, but perhaps the best approach is to view this discovery as the first step to a positive resolution.  Good communication is key to this, and being judgemental usually creates barriers.  Be calm, and see it as a form of communication/expression.  Better communication can be achieved by good listening and better understanding.
Self harm describes a wide range of behaviours that people do to themselves in a deliberate and usually hidden way.  The aim is not to kill themselves but to help them feel better.  In a vast majority of cases self harm remains a secretive behaviour that can go on for a long time without being discovered.
Why do young people self harm?

- Interpersonal factors – difficult relationships at home and/or school, low self esteem, communication difficulties, difficulty in verbalising feelings.
- Individual factors – issues such as depression, eating and sleep disturbance, impulsiveness, physical illness and disability
- Family factors – relationships and breakdown, poor role models, failure to provide support, care, excessive pressure.
