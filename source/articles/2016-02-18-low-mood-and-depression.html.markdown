Most people experience ups and downs in their life, and can feel unhappy, depressed, stressed or anxious during difficult times. This is a normal part of life.  Many difficult events and experiences can leave us in low spirits or cause depression: relationship problems, bereavement, sleep problems, stress at work, bullying, illness, and pain being just a few.

Changes to hormones, such as during puberty, after childbirth and during the menopause, can also have an effect on your emotional and mental health.  But sometimes it's possible to feel down without there being an obvious reason.

What is the difference between low mood and depression?

A general low mood can include:

- Sadness
- An anxious feeling
- Worry tiredness
- Low self esteem
- Frustration
- Anger

However, a low mood will tend to improve after a short time. Making some small changes in your life, such as resolving a difficult situation or talking about your problems and getting more sleep, can improve your mood.
A low mood that doesn't go away can be a sign of depression. Symptoms of depression can include the following:

- continuous low mood or sadness
- feeling hopeless and helpless
- having low self-esteem
- feeling tearful
- feeling guilt-ridden
- feeling irritable and intolerant of others
- finding it difficult to make decisions
- having no motivation or interest in things
- not getting any enjoyment out of life
- having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself
- feeling anxious or worried

Depression can also come on at specific points in your life, such as the winter months (SAD) and after the birth of a child (postnatal depression).
